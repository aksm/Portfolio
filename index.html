				<div class="auth-image" id="profile-pic"></div>

				<p><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sur_and_the_Oranges_of_Hieronymus_Bosch">I have been in love with painting ever since I became conscious of it at the age of six. I drew some pictures I thought fairly good when I was fifty, but really nothing I did before the age of seventy was of any value at all. At seventy-three I have at last caught every aspect of nature&mdash;birds, fish, animals, insects, trees, grasses, all. When I am eighty I shall have developed still further, and I will really master the secrets of art at ninety. When I reach a hundred my work will be truly sublime, and my final goal will be attained around the age of one hundred and ten, when every line and dot I draw will be imbued with life. &mdash;Hokusai</blockquote></p>

				<p>An aspiring full-stack developer (and occasional painter), I aim for Hokusai's level of dedication. My current goal is to get up to basic proficiency so I can get started on mastering all the details. When not coding, I'm working my way through Shakespeare, gaining fluency in Spanish and Korean, and tinkering with everything I encounter.</p>
